#Android Open-source Calculator
No obfuscation is applied to the .apk file just dowwload and decompile it.

This is a simple .apk decompiler : http://www.javadecompilers.com/apk

Note : This app is ONLY tested on my device because GenyMotion is made paid only, my AMD cpu does not support Android SDK integrated VM and of course I dont have time to install new VMs manually. However I'm pretty sure it will work on your device also.
